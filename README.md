## Project Computation Description:

Calculate all prime factors of a given positive integer.
#### Input: A single positive integer n, where 1 â‰¤ n < Integer.MAX_VALUE.
#### Output: A list of prime factors of n.

## Whys Analysis: Difficulty Evaluating Performance Improvement
**Problem** : Initially, we struggled to show the actual improvement achieved by optimizing the ***computePrimeFactors*** method.
- ##### **Why 1** : We focused primarily on documenting the core functionality of  ***computePrimeFactors***.
- ##### **Why 2** : The assumption was that the optimized version was an internal implementation detail, not necessarily user-facing functionality.
- ##### **Why 3** : We hadn't considered the potential benefit of users being aware of the optimized option.
- ##### **Why 4** : Without pre-optimization data, it's impossible to quantify the effectiveness of the implemented optimizations
- #####  **Why 5** : This lack of data made it difficult to convince myself and others that the optimizations were actually making a difference.

## **Actionable Process Change:**
- I learned to use ***System.nanoTime()*** to consistently measure execution time throughout the project. Updated the project documentation to include a clear explanation of the ***computePrimeFactorsOptimized*** method.This should detail its purpose, usage instructions, and any relevant performance benchmarks compared to the standard version.
